Project: Timestamp Microservice
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that handles param requests and outputs a predetermined result. 
Features: User passes a string as a parameter, the app checks to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date.  If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties. 
          
Dependencies: express, bodyparser, cors. To get them type:

- $ npm install
